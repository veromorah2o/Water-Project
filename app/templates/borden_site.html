    <h1>Borden Site Contamination Study</h1>

    <hr>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>With tremendous effort and dedication, a group of scientists managed to actually measure 
       contamination around the Borden Site in Canada over a period of 1038 days – nearly three 
      years – and show the actual path of real contaminants and tracers. The goal of this experiment was to 
      better understand how organic contaminant transport and non-organic contaminant transport are different.
      Tracers are solutions that have nearly zero chance of physically or chemically interacting with other substances 
      or physical aspects of the aquifers.</p>

    <h3>Graphics:</h3>
    <p>The following images show how the contaminants moved over the span of 647 days. The higher the concentration, the more red the region becomes! </p>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>What directions are these contaminants moving?</li>
        <li>In these graphics, you only see contamination at one distance from the surface. How do you think contaminant concentrations change with different depths from the surface?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Advanced Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Do these plumes look similar to those shown in the 2D or ADE examples? If no, what factors do you think play into these differences? </li>
        <li>How to the tracers described previously help scientists understand contamination?</li>
    </ol>
