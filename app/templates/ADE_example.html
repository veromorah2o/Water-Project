    <h1>Advection-Dispersion Equation</h1>

    <hr>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>Advection is the process by which a contaminant is carried along with the velocity of the 
        groundwater. Dispersion is the process by which contaminants spread away from the direct 
        path of flow. These two processes combined can help solve contamination issues through the 
        Advective-Dispersive Equation, or ADE. However, the ADE is idealized and does not always 
        accurately represent what actually happens in these systems. </p>

    <h3>Model Application:</h3>
    <p>The plot below operates on the same time and space scale as the Borden Site example. 
        Change the chemical type and time to see how this plume varies in space. Recall what 
        you previously learned about dispersion to link chemical to spread. </p>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>What directions are these contaminants moving?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Advanced Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Do these plumes look similar to those shown in the 2D or Borden Site examples? 
            If no, what simplifications do you think play a role in these differences? </li>
        <li>Why do you think scientists and engineers use the ADE to make contamination predictions 
            despite the simplifications you previsouly identified?</li>
    </ol>
